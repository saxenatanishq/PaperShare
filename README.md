# PaperShare

PaperShare is a simple web app that helps professors and students manage exam paper reviews online. After exams, professors can upload checked answer sheets, and students can log in to view their papers and ask doubts about any question where they feel their marks should have been higher.

Think of it as a digital version of the usual post-exam process â€” where students wait in long lines to meet professors, discuss their marks, and carry physical copies of their papers. With PaperShare, this entire process happens through a website, saving time and keeping everything clear and organized.

Professors can upload scanned PDFs of the evaluated papers, and students can look at their own papers and send a message if they have a doubt or feel there's a mistake in the marking. These messages are called queries, and professors can reply directly to them inside the app.

The app also allows professors to structure the questions properly â€” including sub-questions like 1(a), 1(b), etc. Students can ask doubts for specific parts like 2(b)(iii), and the professor can view exactly what part the query is about.

## Why is this useful?

In many colleges, the answer sheet checking process ends with just showing the paper to the student. If they have doubts, there's usually no official system to raise those doubts properly or track what the professor said in reply. It often happens through verbal discussion, which can lead to confusion or disputes later.

PaperShare solves this by giving students a proper space to submit doubts, and professors a place to reply â€” all connected to the paper and question number. Once a professor replies, the student sees the response clearly, and everything stays recorded.

It's also helpful for professors who teach large batches. Instead of repeating the same explanation to 50 students, they can just reply inside the app and manage queries at their convenience. Professors can even choose when to stop accepting doubts for a paper by closing the query window.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

PaperShare is distinct from any course project in both its problem space and technical implementation. Rather than emulating a well-known platform (e.g., Wikipedia or social media apps), it is a problem-first system that addresses a specific administrative pain point within academic institutions: the inefficient process of answer sheet reviews after exams.

In most educational institutions, re-evaluation typically involves informal, in-person interactions which are time-consuming, unstructured, and prone to confusion. PaperShare replaces this with a centralized, role-based platform that manages scanned answer sheets, complex question hierarchies, and two-way structured communication.

### Architectural and Data Model Complexity

The platform supports multi-level question structures (like 1(a)(ii)), which are modeled as trees and encoded in JSON. Displaying and managing such structures required implementing tree traversal algorithms (DFS using stack) in both the backend and frontend. Additionally, the system is built to differentiate user roles (student, professor) and enforce custom permission rules, which added significant complexity to both authentication and authorization flows.

Further, the handling of scanned answer sheets in PDF format was a challenge, as Djangoâ€™s default file handling does not offer out-of-the-box features for associating these with specific student-paper combinations. The media handling required precise model relations and validation rules to ensure uploaded files were correctly stored, served, and accessed securely.

### Frontend and UI Decisions

The application also required a JavaScript-enhanced frontend, especially to render nested question formats interactively and allow dynamic query submission. The project is fully mobile responsive, using custom CSS and JavaScript to ensure usability across devices, which was a deliberate design decision to reflect real-world application constraints.

### Summary

This project is more than just a web app â€” itâ€™s a domain-specific tool with strong ties to real institutional workflows. The requirement to model, track, and visualize data interactions between students and professors, in conjunction with media management and data validation, sets it apart in complexity.

## Motivation

The inspiration came from personal frustration with the manual process of reviewing exam answer sheets. Students often wait in long queues, and discussions with professors about marks can be chaotic and undocumented. Here's a snapshot of the real-life chaos this app aims to eliminate:

PaperShare was developed to digitize and formalize this process â€” saving time for both students and professors and increasing transparency.
