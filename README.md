# PaperShare

**PaperShare** is a platform designed for schools and colleges to streamline the post-exam review process. Professors can return checked answer sheets digitally, and students can raise queries if they feel marks need reconsideration. Professors can respond and adjust scores if necessary, ensuring transparent and efficient communication.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### What Makes This Project Unique?

Unlike previous course projects, which often cloned existing platforms (e.g., Gmail, Wikipedia), PaperShare is a problem-first solution developed from scratch to meet a real academic needâ€”handling student-professor interactions after exam results.

### Technical Challenges Faced

1. **File Handling in Django**  
   Integrating and managing PDF files using Djangoâ€™s media system was initially unfamiliar territory.

2. **Complex Question Paper Structures**  
   Handling nested subparts in question papers (e.g., 1(a)(ii)) posed a structural challenge.

### How They Were Solved

1. **Learning Through Documentation**  
   Django documentation and online tutorials were used to understand media file integration.

2. **Using Tree Data Structures**  
   A custom tree structure was implemented and encoded to JSON. It was then decoded using a depth-first search (DFS) approach using stacks.

### Complex Features Implemented

- PDF file handling with media integration.
- Recursive parsing and display of complex question formats using tree-based logic.

## Motivation

The inspiration came from firsthand experience of the frustrating, informal process of physically approaching professors for mark reviews. PaperShare addresses this problem by digitizing and formalizing the process.

## How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the Django application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-github-repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
   - Main Site: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
   - Admin Panel: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Manual Uploads** â€“ Professors must upload each scanned PDF manually.  
2. **No Notifications** â€“ Lack of email or in-app alerts for new queries or responses.  
3. **Limited Access Control** â€“ Professors can stop accepting queries globally but not per question or per student.  
4. **No Analytics or Reporting** â€“ There is no dashboard to view query trends, resolution time, or mark adjustments.  
5. **No Deadline Enforcement** â€“ Query submission deadlines must be manually controlled.

## Future Improvements

1. **Notification System**  
   Add email or in-app notifications when:
   - Queries are raised
   - Professors respond
   - Papers are returned

2. **Query Analytics Dashboard**  
   Include insights such as:
   - Most contested questions
   - Average mark change per student
   - Time taken to resolve queries

3. **Deadline and Scheduling Support**  
   Enable professors to:
   - Set automatic deadlines
   - Schedule start/end times for query submissions

4. **Student Feedback System**  
   Allow students to:
   - Rate responses
   - Reopen unresolved or unsatisfactory queries
   - Provide feedback for improvement
